# [Plum Radio](https://plum-radio.herokuapp.com/)

##Background

Writers often use different exercises to help get them in the mode and gather inspiration. *Plum Radio* takes one of these exercises and moves it to a digital platform. Writers are given a few lines of poetry and a space to respond. Additionally, writers choose between two different modes: Gut mode is timed, writers only have one minutes to respond to each prompt and can choose between a five or ten minute session. Zen mode is untimed and writers choose when to move on. Writers can view there past responses to prompts though the "past lines" tab and can reference or copy/paste to a more permanent place from there.

## Use

Choose either "Gut Mode" or "Zen Mode" from the home page. Gut mode operates in either a five or ten minute session, with new lines populating every minute. Zen mode is untimed and writers can progress at their own pace via the "next" button. Use the textarea to respond to the lines above. To look back at previous entries, use the "Past Lines" tab. If you would like to save your writing, copy and past the text to a safe place on your local machine. A list of citations is found on the "Poets & Poems" page.
